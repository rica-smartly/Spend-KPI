Spend KPI Analysis Documentation
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing spending data to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) that help in understanding and optimizing expenditure. The analysis can be used by businesses to monitor their spending patterns, identify cost-saving opportunities, and make data-driven decisions.

Usage:

Data Processing

The scripts/data_processor.py script is used to clean and preprocess the spending data. Run the script as follows:

Packages: 

1. matplotlib: For data visualization (e.g., plotting spend trends).

2. arviz: For probabilistic modeling and diagnostics (if you're doing Bayesian analysis).

3. Theano: A numerical computation library (commonly used with PyMC3 for Bayesian modeling).

4. ipykernel: Ensures Jupyter Notebook can run Python code properly.

5. scipy: Provides scientific computing tools (e.g., statistical functions).
   
Bayesian analysis (e.g., with PyMC3), ensure you also include it in requirements.txt:

Or use pip install --upgrade theano

Visualizations:

Jupyter notebook, include examples using matplotlib

Bayesian Analysis (Optional):

Bayesian stats, add a notebook example:
