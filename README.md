Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spend-kpi-analysis.git
cd spend-kpi-analysis
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
jupyter notebook
Open the notebooks/spend_analysis.ipynb notebook to start the analysis.

Usage
Data Processing
The scripts/data_processor.py script is used to clean and preprocess the spending data. Run the script as follows:

bash
Copy
python scripts/data_processor.py --input data/sample_data.csv --output data/processed_data.csv
Analysis
Open the Jupyter notebook notebooks/spend_analysis.ipynb to perform the analysis. The notebook includes:

Data loading and exploration

Calculation of KPIs

Visualization of spending trends

Example KPIs
Total Spend: Sum of all expenditures.

Spend by Category: Breakdown of spending by category (e.g., Marketing, Operations).

Monthly Spend Trend: Visualization of spending over time.

Cost per Unit: Calculation of cost efficiency metrics.

Data Sources
The analysis uses a sample dataset (data/sample_data.csv) containing the following columns:

Date: The date of the transaction.

Category: The category of the spend (e.g., Marketing, Operations).

Amount: The amount spent.

Vendor: The vendor or supplier.

Replace the sample data with your actual spending data for real-world analysis.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs are calculated in the analysis:

Total Spend: Sum of all spending.

Spend by Category: Percentage of total spend by category.

Monthly Spend Trend: Monthly aggregation of spending.

Vendor Analysis: Top vendors by total spend.

Cost Efficiency: Cost per unit or cost per outcome (if applicable).
